# Audiobook Manager

I created this application to make it easier for me to organize audiobooks to be served by applications such as [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/).

## Use of the application

This application is made to be used as a docker container. It is intended to read audiobooks in m4b file format from a directory and organize them in a library in another directory.

The docker image reads a few environment variables that can be used to configure how the application works.

| Environment Variable | Default                     | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| PUID                 | 911                         | User id of the user used to run the application           |
| PGID                 | 911                         | Group id of the user used to run the application          |
| AudiobookImportPath  | /input                      | Directory which is scanned for audiobooks to be organized |
| AudiobookLibraryPath | /library                    | Directory which is used as the root of the library        |
| DbLocation           | /config/audiobookmanager.db | Location of the SQLLite database file                     |

The paths specified as environment variables should be mounted to the host system.
